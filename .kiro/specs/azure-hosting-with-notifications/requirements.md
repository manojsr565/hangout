# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves deploying a React-based dating planner app to Azure cloud infrastructure with automated CI/CD pipelines and email notification capabilities. The solution should be cost-effective for personal use (1-2 users) while providing reliable hosting and notification functionality when users submit their plans.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to deploy my React app to Azure using free/basic tier resources, so that I can share the app with others without incurring significant costs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app is deployed THEN it SHALL be accessible via a public URL on Azure
2. WHEN using Azure resources THEN the system SHALL utilize free or basic tier services to minimize costs
3. WHEN the infrastructure is provisioned THEN it SHALL use Terraform for infrastructure as code
4. IF the app receives traffic THEN it SHALL handle 1-2 concurrent users effectively

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated CI/CD pipelines using Azure DevOps, so that code changes are automatically deployed without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to the main branch THEN the system SHALL automatically trigger a build pipeline
2. WHEN the build is successful THEN the system SHALL automatically deploy to Azure
3. WHEN using CI/CD THEN the system SHALL use YAML-based Azure DevOps pipelines
4. IF the build fails THEN the system SHALL prevent deployment and notify of the failure

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to receive email notifications when someone submits a plan, so that I know when the app is being used and can follow up appropriately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes and submits their final plan THEN the system SHALL send an email notification
2. WHEN sending notifications THEN the system SHALL include relevant plan details in the email
3. WHEN using email services THEN the system SHALL use Azure's cost-effective email solutions
4. IF email delivery fails THEN the system SHALL log the error for troubleshooting

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an end user, I want to access the app from any mobile device via a shared link, so that I can create and submit my dating plans easily.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the shared link THEN the app SHALL load properly on mobile devices
2. WHEN using the app THEN it SHALL maintain all existing functionality (plan creation, activity selection, etc.)
3. WHEN submitting a plan THEN the system SHALL process the submission and trigger email notifications
4. IF the user is on a slow connection THEN the app SHALL still load within reasonable time limits

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the infrastructure to be maintainable and scalable, so that I can easily modify or expand the system in the future.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN infrastructure changes are needed THEN they SHALL be manageable through Terraform
2. WHEN the system needs scaling THEN it SHALL support easy resource adjustments
3. WHEN monitoring is required THEN the system SHALL provide basic logging and health checks
4. IF issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide adequate debugging information
